###Prologue
this is my project log before I decided to participate to dev art initiative:

####2010

Back in 2010 I had the following idea:
The information stored in the human dna is represented by a nearly endless sequence of only four different letters: T, C, G and A. What if I interpret those four letters as drawing directions: T means one step up, C one step to the right, and so on. How will it look like? Are there emerging patterns? Could that idea even have scientific relevance?
Back then early experiments showed interesting results, however due to work related obligations this idea moved out of my focus.

####February 2014
Heard about the devart project, old idea popped up, visualisation could be made available to the public as a separate layer with google maps.

####Feb 21 14
started with research about Genetics, mainly wikipedia: genome, dna, chromosome, nucleic bases
came across amino acids: amino acids seem to be defined as a three nucleic bases, there are around 20 amino acids symbolized by letters:
![Amino Acid code sun](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Aminoacids_table.svg "Amino Acid code sun")
**Finding** applying my drawing rules did not lead to specific patters as the line combinations cannot clearly mapped back to the amino acid symbols. -> I'll  stick with drawing rules.

####Feb 23 14, tcg_i1_1


**Data** downloaded chromosome 1 of human from [http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html](http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html)
**Code** first sketch, render chromosome1, all black 10000x10000pixel in size 
![chromosome 1, excerpt](images/2014224_0.41chr1.png?raw=true "chromosome 1, excerpt")

- did several tests with some different mappings of tcga to up right down left.
-outcome was various
-> while t-c-g-a  for up, right, down, left gives the most appealing result,  I stay with this config for now. lets see what all chromosomes at once look like.
done some research: tcga is often referred to as base pairs , where t matches with a, c with g, so they are some kind of counter parts, therefore I seems logic to take t & a and c & g in opposite directions 
data structure: 
the files consist of passages of up to 30 to 40’000 letters of N. I treat it as non relevant data. 
the rest consists of tcga and TCGA, I treat uppercase the same way as lower case letters. 
TODO find out more about the fasta file format
presentation, exhibition: 
did initial drawing of tiles. quadratic prints only those how are used by the visualisation, yields a superstructure well visible from a distance.
600 dpi = ca 200dots per centimeter, 1x1m = 20000x20000 pixels.. no that much…
chr1 is about size of … I should code s step size into filename or something….





According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome, the human genome is divided into 22 chromosomes plus a X and Y chromosomes that define the sex of the individuum. Chromosomes consist of Genes, each Gene is a sequence of basepairs. A base-pair is either represented by T, C, G or A.

I didnt know that it could be affordable for individuals to decipher their genome in the near future...

I think I'll change the project title to "This is you"
